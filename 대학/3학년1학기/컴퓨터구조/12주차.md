### Instruction-Level Parallelism(ILP)
- To increase ILP
	- Deeper pipeline
		- Less work per stage
	- Multiple issue
		- Replicate pipeline stages -> multiple pipelines
- Superpipelined vs. Multiple-Issue

### Multiple Issues
- ILP 를 늘리기 위한 방법론 중 하나. 하나의 clock cycle에 한개 이상의 instruction 을 실행하는거.
- Static Multiple Issue
	- the compiler is responsible for deciding which instructions can be issued in parallel during the compile time.
- Dynamic Multiple Issue
	- the processor itself decides which instructions to issue in parallel at runtime
### Speculation
- technique of executing instructions before it is certain that they are needed.
- Branch prediction
	- Predicting the outcome of a branch instruction (taken or not taken) before the actual condition is evaluated.
- **Data Speculation**
	- Guessing the values of operands or memory addresses before they are actually computed or loaded.
### Loop Unrolling
- Loop 하나에 더 많은 instruction 을 넣어서 효율을 증가시키는 것.
- Loop overhead 줄어들고, branch penalty 가 줄어둠

### Locality
- Temporal Locality
	- Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data or resources within relatively short time intervals. If a particular memory location is accessed, it is likely to be accessed again in the near future.
- Spatial Locality
	- Spatial locality refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations. If a particular memory location is accessed, nearby memory locations ==are likely to be accessed soon.==
### Direct Mapped Cache
- 캐쉬를 block 단위(Line)로 나눈 후 하나의 data block 을 하나의 line에 넣는 방식. 
- 메인 메모리에서 address는 3부분 tag, the index, and the block offset 으로 나눈다.
