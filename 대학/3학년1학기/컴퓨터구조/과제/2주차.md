### EX1. 
(b) Dependability 
(c) Prediction 
(d) Common Case 

### EX2. 
HLL such as C, is compiled into an assembly language, which is then assembled into a machine language. 

### EX3. 
(A) P2 

(B) 
P1: $3 × 10^{10}$     Cycles $2 × 10^{10}$      Instructions 
P2: $2.5 × 10^{10}$ Cycles $2.5 × 10^{10}$    Instructions 
P3: $4 × 10^{10}$    Cycles $1.82 × 10^{10}$  Instructions 

(C) 
P1: 5.13 GHz 
P2: 4.27 GHz 
P3: 6.84 GHz 

### EX4. 
P2 is faster due to 
P2 has $6.66 \times 10^{−4}sec$ CPU Time where as P1 has $10.4 \times 10{−4}$sec 
global CPI of P1 2.6 
global CPI of P2 2.0 

### EX5. 
54.54....
