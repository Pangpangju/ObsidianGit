### EX1
1. When cooperating threads of a parallel program need to synchronize to get proper behavior for reading and writing shared data
2. When cooperating processes on a uniprocessor need to synchronize for reading and writing shared data
-> when using shared resources, it's always the case.

### EX2

```RISC-V
setmax:
	try:
		lr.w x5, (x10)
		bge  x5, x11, release
		addi x5, x11, 0
		sc.w x7, x5, (x10)
		bne  x7, x0, try    //if locked
	release:
		jalr x0, x1
```


### EX3
4. Machine independence
