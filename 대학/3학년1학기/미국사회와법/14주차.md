- General Verdict
	- A general verdict is the most common type of verdict in which the jury provides a simple decision on the outcome of the case—either for the plaintiff or the defendant, and if for the plaintiff, usually specifies the amount of damages awarded.
- Special Verdict
	- A special verdict requires the jury to make specific factual findings rather than simply stating who wins or loses. The jury answers a series of specific questions posed by the judge, and the judge then applies the law to those findings to determine the final judgment.
