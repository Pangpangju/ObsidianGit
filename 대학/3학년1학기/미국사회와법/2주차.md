영화 - Before and After 감상평
1. **Tampering with Evidence**: The father's decision to destroy evidence that could implicate his son is a clear legal violation. This act raises questions about the boundaries of parental love and the extent to which one should go to protect family. Legally, this is obstruction of justice, which carries its own set of penalties, reflecting on the societal importance of a fair and unobstructed legal process.
    
2. **Rights of the Accused**: The film delves into the legal rights of the accused, including the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, the right to a fair trial, and the right to legal representation. It raises questions about how these rights are balanced against the community's desire for justice and the victim's family's need for closure.
    
3. **Ethical Dilemmas in Legal Practice**: The actions of the family, especially the father, can be used to explore ethical considerations in legal practice, such as the duty of a lawyer to their client versus their duty to the court and the law. The film indirectly poses questions about what lawyers should do if they suspect their client is guilty or if they come into possession of evidence that could exonerate or convict their client.
    
4. **Impact of Legal Proceedings on Families**: The movie provides a platform to discuss the psychological, emotional, and financial impact of criminal investigations and trials on the families of both the accused and the victim. This includes the strain on family relationships, the stigma of criminal accusation, and the societal judgment faced by families involved in criminal cases.
    
5. **Justice vs. Truth**: "Before and After" examines the complex relationship between justice and truth. It poses critical questions about the nature of justice: Is it always served by the truth, or are there circumstances under which justice might require a different course of action? The film challenges viewers to consider whether the legal system's goal is the discovery of the truth or the enforcement of laws and societal norms.
