Freedom of the Press 
Americans believe that freedom of the press
   is essential for democracy.

The U.S. Constitution, particularly, 
  the First Amendment,  provides a very strong
  protection of the freedom of the press.

U.S. Supreme Court has been quite active to
  hold in favor of the freedom of the press.

‘Clear and Present Danger’ Test
 
A doctrine adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States to determine under what circumstances limits can be placed on First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, or assembly.
Justice Oliver Wendel Holmes, Jr. proposed 
      in Schenck v. United States (1919)
      to replace the then-existing ‘dangerous (bad)
                                                    tendency test’
      when determining free speech issues related to
      advocacy of violence.
Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) refined the doctrine as
    an ‘immediate lawless action’ test.

Freedom of Speech and  Underlying Theories 
Checking the Government
    A central value of the free press or speech lies in checking the abuse of power by public officials.
Safety Valve for Society
    Punishing people for speech does not discourage the speech; it only drives it underground and encourages conspiracy.
Individual Self-Fulfillment
    An important function of free speech is to enhance the potential of individual contribution to the social welfare.

The ‘Marketplace of Ideas’ Theory
 
 Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
   in Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919)
Built upon the premise that the First Amendment
   prohibits government suppression of ideas because
   the truth of an idea can only be determined in
   the marketplace of competing ideas.

The explicit wording of the First Amendment:
   “Congress shall make no law abridging the
     freedom of speech…”
       cf. “Absolutists” like Justice Hugo L. Black

“Marketplace of Ideas” Theory
   사상의 자유시장이론

John Stuart Mill
1806~1873 
 A rationale for freedom of expression based on an analogy to the economic concept of a free market.

The marketplace of ideas holds that the truth will emerge from the competition of ideas in free and transparent public discourse.

It should be the people or citizens, not the government officials, who decide which ideas or expressions should be circulated.

U.S. Supreme Court’s Approaches 
“Preferred position” for free speech in
    Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943)
    The judiciary needs to be more active to
     protect this value against the will of a temporary majority.

Content-based or Not?
   - If the law regulates the contents of the expression,
      it must serve a compelling state interest and
      must be narrowly written to achieve that interest.
   - The content-neutral laws(i.e. time, place, and manner)
      receive less scrutiny by the court.

The Freedom of Speech
     and ‘Hate Speech’ 
Hate Speech:
Public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation 
10 


## PAGE : 11 
The U.S. Approach to ‘Hate Speech’ 
Limited Regulation: Hate speech laws in the U.S. are limited compared to many European countries. Incitement to violence or specific threats are not protected, but speech that expresses hatred or prejudice towards particular groups is generally allowed unless it directly leads to imminent lawless action. 
Content Neutrality: The government generally cannot restrict speech based on the content of the message. Any restrictions must be viewpoint-neutral and narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. 
Private Regulation: While the government’s ability to regulate hate speech is limited, private entities such as social media platforms can set their own rules and regulations, which sometimes involve restrictions on hate speech.

The Past and Present of 
the Freedom of the Press  
 
In the past, the primary concern of the free press has been the government’s involvement and suppression of the press.

       ☞ Virginia Bill of Rights (1776) Section 12.
  “ That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic governments.”

However, today, not only the government but also many powerful organizations like big companies and religious organizations often interfere or infringe on the freedom of the press.

Dred Scott v. Sandford
60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857) 
In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that black people “are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word ‘citizens’ in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States.”
Two dissenting Justices wrote that some black people actually had been citizens at the time of the Constitution's creation, and also that the majority's opinion went too far in striking down the Missouri Compromise of 1820.

This decision became a contributing factor in the outbreak of the American Civil War four years later in 1861. 
After the Union’s victory in 1865, the decision of Dred Scott case was superseded by direct amendments to the U.S. Constitution, particularly by the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, and by the first clause of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which reads:
  “All persons born or naturalized in the United States,    and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Pace v. Alabama (1883) 
Tony Pace, a black man, and Mary Cox, a white woman, were arrested because their sexual relationship violated the Alabama’s
   anti-miscegenation law.
The law defined “miscegenation” as marriage, cohabitation and sexual relations between whites and blacks, and could sentence 2~7 years in prison.
The Supreme Court held that the Alabama law did not violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because the law was ‘race-neutral’. (punishing the white, too)

Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) 
In 1890, the state of Louisiana passed the Separate Car Act, which required separate accommodations for blacks and whites on railroads, including separate railway cars.
Homer Plessy, a man of mixed race, bought a first-class ticket and boarded on a “white only” car of the East Louisiana Railroad. When he was asked to sit in the blacks-only car, he refused and arrested.
Plessy’s lawyers argued that segregation laws inherently implied that black people were inferior, and therefore stigmatized them with a second-class status that violated the Equal Protection Clause.

## PAGE : 18 
Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) 
The Supreme Court rejected the Plessy’s argument, and  issued a 7–1 decision against Plessy that upheld the constitutionality of Louisiana’s train car segregation laws, and Justice John M. Harlan was the lone dissenter.

The majority wrote,
   “The object of the [Fourteenth] Amendment was undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law, but in the nature of things, it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either.”

The Supreme Court’s unanimous(9-0) decision stated the “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal” and therefore violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

Civil Rights Act of 1964 
The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin, is considered one of the crowning legislative achievements of the civil rights movement. 
First proposed by President John F. Kennedy, it survived strong opposition from southern members of Congress and was then signed into law by Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon B. Johnson.
In subsequent years, Congress expanded the act and passed additional civil rights legislation such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Loving v. Virginia (1967)

Richard and Mildred Loving were charged under the Virginia Code, which prohibited interracial couples from being married out of state and then returning to Virginia. The Code classified miscegenation as a felony,
punishable by a prison sentence of between one and five years.
On January 6, 1959, the Lovings pled guilty to "cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth." They were sentenced to one year in prison, with the sentence suspended on condition that the couple leave Virginia and not return together for at least 25 years.

      - Opinion of Judge Bazile in Commonwealth v. Loving (1965) –

In a unanimous 9-0 decision, the Supreme Court overturned the Lovings’ Virginia criminal convictions and struck down anti-miscegenation laws that forbade marriage between people of different races.

Supreme Court’s Opinion 
in Loving v. Virginia 
“The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. 
     Marriage is one of the “basic civil rights of man,” fundamental to our very existence and survival. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law.”

Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) 
This case addressed the right to counsel in criminal proceedings. Clarence Earl Gideon was charged with breaking in Florida and requested a court-appointed attorney, but his request was denied as Florida law only provided counsel in capital cases. Gideon represented himself and was convicted. He appealed to the Supreme Court, which unanimously ruled that the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, requires states to provide counsel for defendants who cannot afford their own in criminal cases, regardless of the severity of the charges. This decision significantly expanded the rights of criminal defendants and led to the establishment of public defender systems across the United States.

In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires all states to grant same-sex marriages and recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions. Obergefell v. Hodges extended marriage equality to all 50 states, marking a significant milestone for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.

Background and Facts on the Marbury Case





bMarbury v. Madison (1803) 
36 
In the presidential election of 1800, Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist John Adams.
During the lame-duck session, Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801. This Act established ten new district courts, expanding the number of circuit courts from three to six, and giving the President the authority to appoint Federal judges and justices of the peace. The act also reduced the number of Supreme Court justices from six to five.
On March 3, just before his term was to end, Adams, in an attempt to stymie the incoming Democratic-RepublicanCongress and administration, appointed 16 Federalist circuit judges and 42 Federalist justices of the peace to offices created by the Judiciary Act of 1801. These appointees, the infamous “Midnight Judges”, included William Marbury, a prosperous financier in Maryland.
The case resulted from a petition to the Supreme Court by William Marbury, who had been appointed Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia by President John Adams but whose commission was not subsequently delivered.

    a plaintiff’s right to recover in cases like the present one.

    Key Facts:
Helen Palsgraf was standing on a platform at the Long Island Railroad station.
Two railroad employees helped a man carrying a package to board a moving train.
The package, which contained fireworks, fell and exploded when the man was assisted.
The explosion caused scales at the other end of the platform to fall, injuring Palsgraf.
Palsgraf sued the railroad for negligence, claiming the employees’ actions caused her injuries.

    Judgment:
The Court of Appeals of New York, led by Chief Judge Benjamin Cardozo, ruled in favor of the railroad.
The court held that the railroad was not liable for Palsgraf’s injuries because there was no foreseeable risk of harm to her from the employees’ actions.

Contingent Fee
  성공보수, 성공사례금 
A contingent fee arrangement is a payment structure where an attorney’s fee is contingent upon the successful resolution of a case. The lawyer receives a percentage of the client’s award or settlement, typically used in personal injury, workers’ compensation, and other civil litigation cases.
In the U.S., no federal laws universally govern contingent fees. Instead, regulation is primarily state-based.

Contingent Fee
  성공보수, 성공사례금 
States often cap the percentage that can be charged, with common limits being 33.3% for standard cases and up to 40% for more complex or risky cases.
Some states require contingent fee agreements to be in writing and signed by both the client and attorney, detailing the fee calculation and what costs may be deducted from the recovery.

        Conflicts of Interest:
• Lawyers must avoid conflicts of interest and prioritize the client’s interests.
• Contingent fees can create potential conflicts, especially if a lawyer is motivated to settle quickly rather than pursue a higher award through extended litigation.
• Lawyers must maintain clear and open communication with clients regarding the contingent fee structure, potential expenses, and any changes to the agreement.

The mailbox rule, also known as the postal acceptance rule, is a principle in American contract law that governs the timing of acceptance for contract offers when the parties communicate through mail or similar means.

                 cf. the receipt rule 
The “Mailbox Rule” 
92 


## PAGE : 93 
The mailbox rule states that an acceptance of an offer becomes effective when it is dispatched (i.e., placed in the control of the postal service), rather than when it is received by the offeror. This rule is designed to provide clarity and fairness in contract formation by establishing a specific moment when acceptance occurs, thereby forming a binding contract.

 Consideration is a fundamental concept in the formation of contracts under U.S. law. It refers to something of value that is exchanged between parties to form a binding agreement. 

Consideration is defined as a benefit or detriment that a party receives or incurs, which motivates them to enter into the agreement. It can take various forms, such as money, services, goods, or a promise to act or refrain from acting in a certain way.

Examples of Consideration 
97 


## PAGE : 98 
Promissory Estoppel: In some cases, a promise may be enforceable without consideration if one party reasonably relies on the promise to their detriment.
Moral Obligation: Some jurisdictions may enforce promises based on a moral obligation, though this is rare and typically limited to specific circumstances, such as past consideration that involved a material benefit to the promisor.
Contracts Under Seal: Historically, contracts under seal did not require consideration, though this is largely outdated and abolished in most jurisdictions.
 
Exceptions to the Requirement of Consideration 
98 


## PAGE : 99 
Preexisting Duty Rule: If a party promises to do something they are already legally obligated to do, this is not a valid consideration.

Past Consideration: Acts or benefits given before the promise is made do not constitute valid consideration because they were not bargained for in exchange for the promise.
